# UI Review Notes - Comparing Current vs Mockups

## Current State Issues (from screenshot):

1. **Hero Section Layout**: 
   - Current: Title text is on LEFT side with image grid, KPI cards floating on RIGHT
   - Mockup IMG_1502: Similar layout but more polished - title on left, KPI cards floating on right over background
   - Issue: The current layout is actually close but needs refinement

2. **KPI Cards Positioning**:
   - Current: 4 floating KPI cards on right side (GDP Growth, Inflation, Exchange Rate x2)
   - Mockup: Shows 4 cards with compass in center
   - Issue: Compass element needs better styling, cards need better shadow/positioning

3. **Background Images**:
   - Current: Grid of 4 images (data screens, laptop, solar panels, port)
   - Mockup: Similar collage style
   - Status: Acceptable but could be improved

4. **Bottom KPI Row**:
   - Current: 4 cards (GDP +2.5%, Inflation 15%, Reserves $3.2B, Labor Force 6.5M)
   - Mockup IMG_1500: Same style with gold icons, beige backgrounds, sparklines
   - Status: Matches mockup well

5. **Sector Cards**:
   - Current: Grid of sector buttons with icons
   - Mockup IMG_1499: Cards with actual images (port, market, terraces)
   - Issue: Need to add image-based sector cards like mockup

## Key Fixes Needed:
1. Add compass element in center of KPI cards cluster
2. Improve KPI card shadows and positioning
3. Add image-based sector cards section (Trade & Commerce, Local Economy, Rural Development)
4. Ensure proper RTL layout for Arabic
