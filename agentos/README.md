# AgentOS

This folder is a version-controlled prompt + policy library.

- `policies/` — non-negotiable laws (evidence, licensing, Yemen split-system)
- `prompts/` — longer reusable prompts (mirrors Cursor slash commands)
- `evals/` — evaluation checklists (release gates, evidence coverage)

The goal: reduce copy/paste and make work reproducible.
