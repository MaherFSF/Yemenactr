# Yemen Economy Research: Chatham House

This document summarizes key findings on Yemen's economy from Chatham House publications, focusing on the period between 2014 and 2026.

## Findings from "Moving beyond handouts: The strategic imperative for domestic resource mobilization in Yemen" (July 31, 2025)

### Key Economic Indicators and Statistics

*   **Hydrocarbon Revenues:** Following Houthi attacks on oil export infrastructure in southern Yemen in 2022, hydrocarbon revenues have declined by nearly 70%.
*   **Currency Depreciation:** The Yemeni Rial lost 33.7% of its value in the first half of 2025.
*   **Remittances:** In 2023, remittances were estimated at $6.7 billion, with $2.5 billion originating in Saudi Arabia. Remittances are now Yemen's largest external income source.

### Major Events and Policy Decisions

*   **2022:** Houthi attacks on oil export infrastructure in southern Yemen.
*   **2022:** Formation of the Presidential Leadership Council.
*   **2025:** Appointment of a new prime minister in April.
*   **Recent:** US re-designation of the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

### Analysis and Recommendations

*   Yemen is facing a severe fiscal crisis due to declining oil revenues and external support.
*   The government must urgently diversify its revenue base away from oil.
*   **Recommendation:** Reform tax and customs systems to increase domestic revenue.
*   **Recommendation:** Leverage financial inflows from the Yemeni diaspora by reactivating overseas branches of the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
*   **Recommendation:** Explore emerging climate finance instruments as a potential source of funding.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate public revenues from resource-rich governorates like Marib, Al-Mahra, and Hadhramaut.
*   **Recommendation:** Reinstate a formal budget process to improve transparency and public trust.

### Data Sources and Methodology

*   Information on financial support from Saudi Arabia and the UAE was attributed to a senior source in the Yemeni Economic Team.
*   Data on remittances was provided by officials at Yemen’s Central Bank in Aden.

### Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

*   The current fiscal model, reliant on oil revenues and external aid, is unsustainable.
*   **Projection:** Without significant reforms, the Yemeni Rial will continue to depreciate, and protests are likely to worsen.
*   **Projection:** Failure to diversify revenue could lead to the collapse of the government and further territorial gains by the Houthis.


## Findings from "Yemen: National Chaos, Local Order" (December 20, 2017)

### Key Economic Indicators and Statistics

*   **Customs Revenue:** In 2013, Yemen's total customs revenue was $1.065 billion. Hodeidah port accounted for 41% of this revenue, and the Aden free zone for 26%.
*   **Inflation:** Checkpoint fees are estimated to inflate the prices of basic goods like wheat by 10-15%.

### Major Events and Policy Decisions

*   **2014:** A UN Panel of Experts was formed to oversee a sanctions regime.
*   **2016:** The Houthi-Saleh alliance imposed a blockade on Taiz.

### Analysis and Recommendations

*   Yemen has become a 'chaos state' with a fragmented economy.
*   Despite the conflict, trade continues to flow across the country, creating a war economy that benefits various armed groups.
*   Control of trade routes, ports, and checkpoints has become a major source of revenue for local power brokers.
*   The banking system has been severely damaged, but trade is facilitated by hawala money-transfer networks.
*   **Analysis:** The war economy creates incentives for armed groups to prolong the conflict and spoil peace processes.

### Data Sources and Methodology

*   Data on customs revenue is from the Yemen Customs Authority.
*   Information on trade and the war economy is based on interviews with Yemeni traders and a Yemeni analyst.
*   The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen is cited as a source for information on illicit goods and arms trafficking.
*   Data on wheat, flour, and diesel prices is from the World Food Programme.

### Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

*   **Finding:** Arms and munitions provided by the Saudi-led coalition are being sold and transferred to Houthi and Saleh forces.
*   **Finding:** Ammunition prices in Yemen have fallen since the war began, suggesting a steady supply.
*   **Projection:** The integrated war economy will continue to complicate and prolong the conflict.
