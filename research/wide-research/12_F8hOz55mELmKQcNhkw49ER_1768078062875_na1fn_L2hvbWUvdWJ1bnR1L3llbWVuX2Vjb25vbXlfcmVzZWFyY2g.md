# Yemen Economic Research Findings

This document compiles research on Yemen's economy, with a focus on the relocation of commercial banks and their status from 2024-2026.


## Relocation of Commercial Banks (2024-2025)

In a significant development for Yemen's banking sector, eight major commercial banks have initiated the process of relocating their headquarters from the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa, to the internationally recognized government's temporary capital, Aden. This move follows a directive issued by the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) in Aden in April 2024, which mandated all commercial banks to relocate within 60 days to comply with international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations [1].

The banks that have officially communicated their intention to relocate are:

* Tadhamon Bank
* Al-Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank
* Yemen Bahrain Bank
* Yemen Islamic Bank for Finance and Investment
* Saba Islamic Bank
* Yemen Gulf Bank
* Yemen Commercial Bank
* Amal Bank for Microfinance

This decision is also heavily influenced by escalating international pressure on the Houthis, including their re-designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the United States. The banks aim to avoid potential repercussions of US sanctions, such as asset freezes and legal actions against financial institutions operating in Houthi-controlled areas [1].

### Timeline of Events:

*   **April 2024:** The CBY-Aden issues a resolution requiring all Yemeni banks to relocate their headquarters to Aden within 60 days [1].
*   **June 2024:** After the deadline expires, the CBY-Aden imposes punitive measures on non-compliant banks, including the suspension of the SWIFT system for six commercial banks in Sanaa. In response, the Houthi-controlled Central Bank branch in Sanaa suspends 13 banks headquartered in Aden [1].
*   **January 2025:** The US Treasury Department imposes sanctions on Yemen Kuwait Bank for Trade and Investment, accusing it of providing financial support to the Houthi group [1].
*   **March 2025:** Eight commercial banks officially inform the CBY-Aden of their intention to relocate their headquarters to Aden [1].

## Key Economic Indicators (2026 Projections)

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides the following economic projections for Yemen for the year 2026 [2]:

| Indicator | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Real GDP growth (annual percent change) | 0% |
| GDP, current prices (billions of U.S. dollars) | Not specified |
| GDP per capita, current prices (U.S. dollars per capita) | $401.28 |
| Inflation rate, average consumer prices (annual percent change) | 18.5% |
| General government gross debt (percent of GDP) | 68.5% |
| Current account balance (billions of U.S. dollars) | -$1.633 |

These figures indicate a challenging economic outlook for Yemen, with stagnant growth, high inflation, and significant government debt.

## World Bank Economic Monitor (Fall 2024)

According to the World Bank's Fall 2024 Yemen Economic Monitor, the country's economy is facing deepening challenges. Key findings from the report include:

*   **GDP Contraction:** Yemen's GDP was projected to contract by 1% in 2024, following a 2% decline in 2023. This has contributed to a 54% drop in real GDP per capita since 2015 [3].
*   **Fiscal Crisis:** The Houthi blockade on oil exports led to a 42% drop in fiscal revenues for the Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) in the first half of 2024, hindering its ability to provide essential services [3].
*   **Currency Depreciation:** The Yemeni Rial depreciated in the Aden market from 1,619 per US dollar in January 2024 to 1,917 by the end of August 2024 [3].
*   **Food Insecurity:** Over 60% of the population faces inadequate access to food, with severe food deprivation more than doubling in some governorates in July 2024 [3].
*   **Banking Sector Risks:** The report highlights potential risks to Yemen's banking sector due to tensions between the Houthis and the IRG over regulatory control [3].

## Analysis and Recommendations

The relocation of major commercial banks from Sanaa to Aden is a critical development with significant implications for Yemen's already fragile economy. This move, driven by the Central Bank of Aden's directive and the desire to avoid international sanctions, further deepens the economic fragmentation between the Houthi-controlled north and the internationally recognized government in the south.

The data from the IMF and World Bank paints a grim picture of Yemen's economic situation. Stagnant GDP growth, high inflation, a depreciating currency, and a severe humanitarian crisis characterized by widespread food insecurity create a challenging environment for any meaningful economic recovery. The conflict has decimated the country's productive capacity, and the ongoing political instability and division of key institutions like the central bank exacerbate the economic crisis.

The Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies report highlights the urgent need for external financial support to stabilize the Yemeni rial and prevent a complete economic collapse. The report also emphasizes the importance of mitigating the impact of sanctions on the civilian population and facilitating the continued operation of the financial sector.

Based on the research, the following recommendations are proposed:

*   **International Support:** A substantial and sustained financial support package from the international community is crucial to stabilize the Yemeni rial, finance the import of essential goods, and support the government's capacity to provide basic services.
*   **Unified Monetary Policy:** Efforts should be made to reunify the Central Bank of Yemen and establish a unified monetary policy for the entire country. This would help to stabilize the currency, control inflation, and restore confidence in the banking sector.
*   **Humanitarian Aid:** Humanitarian aid must be sustained and scaled up to address the severe food insecurity and prevent a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.
*   **Peace Process:** A comprehensive and inclusive peace process is the only long-term solution to Yemen's economic and humanitarian crisis. The international community should redouble its efforts to support a political settlement to the conflict.
