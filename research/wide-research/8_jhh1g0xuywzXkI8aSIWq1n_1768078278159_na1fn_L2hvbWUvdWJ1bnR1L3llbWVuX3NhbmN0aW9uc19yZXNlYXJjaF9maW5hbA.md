## 3. Major Events and Policy Decisions by Year

### 2014-2022

The period between 2014 and 2022 was marked by the escalation of the civil war, leading to a fractured economy and the emergence of two competing central banks. The internationally recognized government, based in Aden, and the Houthi authorities in Sana'a implemented divergent monetary and fiscal policies, further deepening the economic crisis. During this time, the OFAC began to impose sanctions on individuals and entities associated with the conflict.

### 2023

The economic situation continued to deteriorate in 2023, with a significant contraction in GDP and a widening trade balance deficit. The suspension of oil exports in late 2022 resulted in a substantial loss of revenue for the government, contributing to a growing budget deficit.

### 2024

2024 saw an unprecedented escalation of U.S. sanctions against the Houthis, including their redesignation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). These sanctions targeted key financial networks and individuals, aiming to disrupt the Houthis' revenue streams. The banking sector faced immense pressure, with the monetary split between Aden and Sana'a becoming more pronounced. The Yemeni Riyal experienced a sharp depreciation in government-controlled areas, while the cost of living soared due to rising inflation and increased shipping costs.

### 2025-2026

The economic outlook for 2025 and beyond remains bleak. The continuation of sanctions, coupled with the ongoing conflict and political instability, is expected to lead to further economic deterioration. The humanitarian crisis is likely to worsen, with millions of Yemenis facing food insecurity and a lack of access to basic services.

## 4. Analysis and Recommendations

The sanctions imposed on Yemen have had a complex and multifaceted impact on the country's economy. While they have aimed to pressure the Houthis and disrupt their financial networks, they have also had unintended consequences for the civilian population and the broader economy.

**Analysis:**

*   **Humanitarian Impact:** The sanctions have complicated the delivery of humanitarian aid and remittances, which are vital for millions of Yemenis. The designation of the Houthis as an FTO has created significant challenges for aid organizations operating in the country.
*   **Economic Fragmentation:** The sanctions have exacerbated the fragmentation of Yemen's economy, with the banking sector being particularly affected. The monetary split between the central banks in Aden and Sana'a has created a dual currency system, further complicating financial transactions.
*   **Private Sector Challenges:** The private sector has been caught in the crossfire, facing violations, extortion, and the risk of being associated with sanctioned entities. The business environment has become increasingly difficult, hindering economic recovery.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Targeted Sanctions:** Sanctions should be carefully targeted to minimize their impact on the civilian population and the broader economy. Humanitarian exemptions should be clear and effectively implemented to ensure the continued flow of aid.
*   **Economic Dialogue:** There is a need for a comprehensive economic dialogue between the warring parties to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis. This should include discussions on unifying the central bank and establishing a transparent and accountable system for managing public finances.
*   **Support for the Private Sector:** The international community should provide support to the Yemeni private sector to help it withstand the challenges of the conflict and sanctions. This could include technical assistance, access to finance, and support for trade facilitation.

## 5. Data Sources and Methodology

This report is based on a comprehensive review of publicly available data and reports from the following sources:

1.  **U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC):** The OFAC website provided data on sanctions designations and the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.
2.  **Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies:** The Sana'a Center's reports provided in-depth analysis of the economic impact of the sanctions and the broader economic situation in Yemen.
3.  **Studies and Economic Media Center (SEMC):** The SEMC's annual economic report offered valuable insights into key economic indicators, the challenges facing the private sector, and the impact of the conflict on the Yemeni economy.

The methodology involved a systematic review of these sources to extract relevant data and information. The findings were then synthesized and analyzed to provide a comprehensive overview of Yemen's economy and the impact of sanctions.

## 6. Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

*   **Dual Economy:** Yemen is effectively operating as a dual economy, with different economic conditions and policies in government-controlled and Houthi-controlled areas. This has created significant challenges for businesses and individuals operating across the country.
*   **Resilience of Illicit Networks:** Despite the sanctions, illicit financial networks have shown a high degree of resilience, adapting their methods to circumvent restrictions. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to tackling illicit finance.
*   **Long-Term Economic Recovery:** The prospects for long-term economic recovery in Yemen are bleak. The ongoing conflict, political instability, and the impact of sanctions have created a perfect storm that is likely to continue to depress economic activity for the foreseeable future.

**Projections:**

*   The Yemeni economy is projected to continue to contract in the coming years, with GDP growth remaining in negative territory.
*   Inflation is expected to remain high, further eroding the purchasing power of households.
*   The humanitarian crisis is likely to worsen, with an increasing number of Yemenis requiring assistance.
