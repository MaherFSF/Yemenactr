# Yemen's Economic Landscape: A Nation in Crisis

## Introduction

Yemen, a low-income country, is grappling with profound and enduring challenges to its economic stability and growth. The protracted conflict has inflicted severe damage on the nation's economy, leading to a cessation of exports, a volatile currency, soaring inflation, and critical shortages of essential imports like food and fuel. The war has also precipitated a humanitarian catastrophe of staggering proportions, further compounding the country's economic woes. This report provides a comprehensive overview of Yemen's economic situation, with a particular focus on the critical period between 2010 and 2026, the regulation of money exchangers, and the Central Bank of Yemen's (CBY) 2025 campaign.

## The Fractured Monetary Authority and the Currency War

A pivotal development in Yemen's economic crisis has been the fragmentation of its central monetary authority. Since September 2016, two rival branches of the Central Bank of Yemen have been in operation: the internationally recognized headquarters in Aden and the Houthi-controlled branch in the capital, Sana'a [1]. This schism has given rise to a destructive "currency war," characterized by a series of competing and often contradictory monetary policies.

The Aden-based CBY, in an effort to finance the government's widening budget deficit, embarked on an expansionary monetary policy, issuing over 1.7 trillion Yemeni rials in new banknotes by the end of 2019 [1]. In response, the Houthi authorities in Sana'a took the drastic step of banning the circulation of these new banknotes within the territories under their control. This measure was ostensibly aimed at curbing inflation, safeguarding their foreign currency reserves, and preserving their grip on the financial system [1].

This monetary tug-of-war has had far-reaching consequences, most notably the emergence of two distinct exchange rates for the Yemeni rial. The value of the currency now varies significantly between government-held and Houthi-controlled areas, creating a complex and fragmented economic landscape [1].

## The 2025 Campaign: A Flurry of Regulations

The year 2025 witnessed a concerted effort by the Yemeni government and the Aden-based CBY to assert control over the economy and stabilize the national currency. A series of stringent regulations were introduced, targeting both foreign currency transactions and the operations of money exchangers.

On July 30, 2025, the Yemeni Cabinet issued a sweeping decree that prohibited the use of all foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, in domestic transactions. This ban extended to all commercial and service transactions, rental agreements, tuition and medical fees, and financial contracts, with the Yemeni rial being declared the sole legal tender for all internal dealings [2].

This was followed by a series of directives from the CBY in Aden in early August 2025, aimed at reining in the activities of money exchange companies. These new regulations included:

*   A cap of $2,000 on any single foreign currency transfer or sale for personal use [3].
*   A mandate for exchange companies to verify the purpose of each transaction and to collect supporting documentation, such as passports, visas, and medical reports [3].
*   A requirement for all exchange businesses to submit detailed daily reports of their foreign currency transactions to the central bank [3].
*   The imposition of a fixed exchange rate for the Saudi riyal, with a maximum purchase price of 425 Yemeni rials and a selling price of 428 [3].

To enforce these new rules, the CBY suspended the licenses of 43 exchange companies for non-compliance [3]. These measures did have a noticeable, albeit likely temporary, impact, with the Yemeni rial reportedly recovering approximately 50% of its value in government-controlled areas in the immediate aftermath [3].

## Analysis and Recommendations

The data and events outlined in this report paint a grim picture of an economy in a state of near-total collapse. The fragmentation of the Central Bank and the ensuing currency war have created a chaotic and unpredictable economic environment, stifling trade, investment, and growth. The 2025 campaign, while well-intentioned, is unlikely to have a lasting impact in the absence of a comprehensive political settlement and a unified monetary authority.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Reunification of the Central Bank:** The international community should prioritize and facilitate the reunification of the Central Bank of Yemen. A single, independent, and credible monetary authority is a prerequisite for economic stability.
*   **A New, Unified Currency:** A new, unified currency should be introduced to replace the existing banknotes and the e-Rial. This would help to eliminate the dual exchange rate system and restore confidence in the national currency.
*   **Humanitarian and Development Assistance:** International donors should continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Yemeni people, while also investing in long-term development projects to rebuild the country's infrastructure and economy.
*   **Political Settlement:** Ultimately, a lasting solution to Yemen's economic crisis can only be achieved through a comprehensive political settlement that ends the conflict and restores peace and stability to the country.

## Projections for 2026

Economic forecasts for Yemen in 2026 present a mixed and uncertain picture, heavily contingent on the country's political and security situation. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a contraction in real GDP of 1.5% and a significant increase in consumer prices of 20.4% [5]. In contrast, some news outlets project a modest economic growth of 2.7% for the same year [6].

The World Bank offers a more optimistic long-term perspective, suggesting that under a sustained peace scenario, Yemen's economy could grow by an average of 5% annually over the next 15 years, driven by renewed investment [7]. However, the immediate outlook remains dire, with organizations like the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) projecting continued high levels of acute food insecurity through at least May 2026 [8].
