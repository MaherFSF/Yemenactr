# Comprehensive Economic Analysis of Yemen (2010-2026)

## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Yemeni economy from 2010 to 2026. It examines key economic indicators, the impact of major events, the business environment, and the role of the private sector. The analysis is based on data from the World Bank, the "Rethinking Yemen’s Economy" report, and other credible sources. The objective is to offer a detailed understanding of the economic challenges and opportunities in Yemen, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict and the prospects for post-conflict recovery.

## 1. Macroeconomic Overview

Yemen's economy has been in a state of severe crisis for over a decade. The following sections provide an overview of the key macroeconomic indicators that illustrate the extent of the economic collapse.

### 1.1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

GDP is a primary indicator of a country's economic health. As the data below shows, Yemen's GDP has experienced a dramatic decline since the escalation of the conflict in 2015.

| Year | GDP Growth (Annual %) | Source     |
| :--- | :-------------------- | :--------- |
| 2010 | ~8%                   | World Bank |
| 2011 | ~-12%                 | World Bank |
| 2012 | ~2%                   | World Bank |
| 2013 | ~4%                   | World Bank |
| 2014 | ~-1%                  | World Bank |
| 2015 | ~-28%                 | World Bank |
| 2016 | ~-9%                  | World Bank |
| 2017 | ~-5%                  | World Bank |
| 2018 | 0.8%                  | World Bank |

**Analysis:** The data reveals a significant economic shock following the 2011 uprising and a catastrophic collapse after 2014. The cumulative effect has been a contraction of over 40% of the economy, pushing millions into poverty.

### 1.2. Inflation and Exchange Rate

The conflict has also triggered a severe currency crisis, with the Yemeni Rial (YR) depreciating sharply against the US dollar. This has fueled hyperinflation and eroded the purchasing power of ordinary Yemenis.

*   **Exchange Rate:** The exchange rate deteriorated from approximately 215 YR/USD in 2015 to 490 YR/USD by mid-2018.
*   **Inflation:** While specific inflation figures are difficult to obtain for the entire period, the massive currency depreciation has undoubtedly led to soaring prices for essential goods, most of which are imported.

## 2. The Business Environment

The business environment in Yemen is one of the most challenging in the world. The World Bank's "Doing Business 2020" report ranked Yemen 187th out of 190 economies.

| Indicator                  | Rank | Details                                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Starting a Business**    | 156  | 41 days and 40.2% of income per capita cost. Women face extra hurdles.    |
| **Getting Credit**         | 186  | Legal rights for borrowers and lenders are extremely weak (0/12 score). |
| **Enforcing Contracts**     | 143  | Takes 645 days and costs 30% of the claim value.                        |
| **Resolving Insolvency**   | 159  | Recovery rate is only 21 cents on the dollar, and the process takes 3 years. |

**Analysis:** These indicators paint a grim picture of the institutional framework for business in Yemen. The lack of legal protection for investors, the difficulty of enforcing contracts, and the cumbersome bureaucracy are major impediments to private sector development.

## 3. The Private Sector

Despite the hostile environment, the Yemeni private sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience. It plays a vital role in importing essential goods and providing employment for a significant portion of the population.

### 3.1. Challenges

*   **Conflict-related disruptions:** The war has caused widespread destruction of infrastructure, disrupted supply chains, and created a severe security crisis.
*   **Lack of access to finance:** The collapse of the banking sector has made it nearly impossible for businesses to obtain credit.
*   **Humanitarian crisis:** The devastating humanitarian crisis has led to a collapse in demand and a loss of consumer purchasing power.

### 3.2. Recommendations for Support

The "Rethinking Yemen’s Economy" report proposes a number of recommendations to support the private sector in a post-conflict scenario:

*   **Conflict-sensitive approach:** Interventions must be carefully designed to avoid fueling the conflict and to support legitimate businesses.
*   **Capacity building:** Providing training and technical assistance to local businesses is crucial for their long-term survival and growth.
*   **Financial inclusion:** Restoring the financial sector and creating new financing mechanisms is essential to unlock the potential of the private sector.

## 4. Conclusion and Outlook

Yemen's economy is on the brink of total collapse. The ongoing conflict has inflicted immense damage on the country's productive capacity and has created a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions. While the private sector has shown incredible resilience, it cannot be expected to drive a recovery on its own.

A sustainable economic recovery in Yemen will require a comprehensive and coordinated effort from the international community, the Yemeni government, and the private sector. The immediate priority must be to end the conflict and restore peace and stability. In the long term, a successful recovery will depend on a combination of factors, including:

*   **A stable and inclusive political settlement.**
*   **Large-scale international assistance for reconstruction and development.**
*   **Comprehensive economic reforms to address the country's deep-seated structural weaknesses.**
*   **A vibrant and empowered private sector.**

The road to recovery will be long and arduous, but with the right policies and support, Yemen can emerge from the current crisis and build a more prosperous and peaceful future.
