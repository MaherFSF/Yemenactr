## Summary and Analysis

The collected data from the Central Bank of Yemen's annual reports for 2020, 2023, and 2024 show a volatile economic situation in Yemen. 

**GDP:** The GDP at market prices has shown significant fluctuation. While there was growth in 2020 and 2024 in terms of Yemeni Rials, the USD equivalent shows a different picture, with a major drop in 2023 and a slight recovery in 2024. This indicates a severe depreciation of the local currency. The halt in oil exports in 2023 and 2024 has had a significant negative impact on the economy.

**Inflation:** The Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows high and fluctuating inflation rates. The high inflation in 2020 and 2024, coupled with the depreciation of the Yemeni Rial, has severely eroded the purchasing power of the population.

**Exchange Rate:** The exchange rate of the Yemeni Rial against the US Dollar has been on a continuous and steep depreciation trend. This is a major driver of inflation and economic instability.

**Government Finances:** The government's finances are under severe strain, with a persistent budget deficit. The reliance on grants and borrowing from the Central Bank to finance the deficit is not sustainable and contributes to inflation.

**External Sector:** The external sector is characterized by a large and growing current account deficit. The suspension of oil exports has been a major blow to the country's export earnings, while the import bill, especially for food and fuel, remains high.
