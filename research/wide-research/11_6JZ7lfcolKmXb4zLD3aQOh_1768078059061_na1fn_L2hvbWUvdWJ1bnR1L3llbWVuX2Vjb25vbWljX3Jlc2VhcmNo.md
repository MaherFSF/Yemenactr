## 2. Major Events and Policy Decisions by Year

### 2016

*   The Central Bank of Yemen was split into two rival institutions: one in the capital, Sana’a, run by the Houthi movement, and an internationally recognized one in Aden [2]. This event marked the beginning of a protracted period of economic and monetary fragmentation in Yemen.

### 2024

*   **March:** The Houthi authorities in Sana'a began minting their own 100-rial coins, escalating the currency war with the internationally recognized government in Aden [2].
*   **July:** The Houthi-affiliated Central Bank of Yemen in Sana’a (CBY-Sana’a) issued a new 50-rial coin and a new 200-rial banknote. The stated purpose was to replace damaged and worn-out banknotes, but the move was denounced by the CBY-Aden as a counterfeit and destructive act [2].

## 3. Analysis and Recommendations

The Yemeni economy has been in a state of turmoil since the political and institutional split of the Central Bank in 2016. The existence of two competing monetary authorities has led to a currency war, with both sides issuing their own currency and implementing divergent monetary policies. This has resulted in a significant depreciation of the Yemeni Rial, high inflation, and a severe economic crisis.

The data from the Central Bank of Yemen - Aden's 2024 Annual Report indicates a dire economic situation. While there was a nominal increase in GDP in local currency, the US dollar equivalent shows a contraction of the economy. The complete halt of oil exports, a major source of revenue, has exacerbated the crisis. The high inflation rate and the depreciation of the currency have severely impacted the purchasing power of the Yemeni people.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Unification of Monetary Policy:** The international community should facilitate a dialogue between the two central banks to unify monetary policy and address the currency crisis. A unified and stable monetary policy is a prerequisite for economic recovery.
*   **Humanitarian Aid:** Continued and increased humanitarian aid is crucial to address the immediate needs of the population. This aid should be delivered in a way that supports local markets and does not undermine local production.
*   **Economic Reconstruction:** A long-term plan for economic reconstruction and development is needed to rebuild the country's infrastructure and create sustainable economic growth. This plan should focus on diversifying the economy and reducing its dependence on oil exports.

## 4. Data Sources and Methodology

The information in this report is based on the following sources:

1.  **Central Bank of Yemen - Aden, Annual Report 2024:** This report provided the primary data for the key economic indicators.
2.  **Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies:** The article "Currency War Threatens to Deepen Yemen's Monetary Rift" provided context and information on the monetary policies of the Central Bank of Yemen in Sana'a.

## 5. Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

*   The Yemeni economy is projected to continue to contract in the coming years if the current political and economic crisis is not resolved. The ongoing conflict and the division of the Central Bank will continue to deter investment and hinder economic activity.
*   Inflation is expected to remain high, further eroding the living standards of the population. The depreciation of the currency and the reliance on imports for essential goods will continue to drive up prices.
*   The currency is likely to continue to depreciate without a unified monetary policy and a significant injection of foreign currency. The currency war between the two central banks will continue to undermine confidence in the Yemeni Rial.
