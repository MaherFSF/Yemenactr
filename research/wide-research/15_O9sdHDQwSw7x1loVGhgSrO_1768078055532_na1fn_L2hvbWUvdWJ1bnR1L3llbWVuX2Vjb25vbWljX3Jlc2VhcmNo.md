# Yemen Economic Research Findings

This document compiles comprehensive data about Yemen's economy, focusing on the period from 2010 to 2026.


## The Internationally Recognized Government (IRG)

The Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) refers to the institutions of the Yemeni state that are recognized by the international community. The IRG is based in the interim capital of Aden since February 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi fled Yemen’s capital Sanaa, after it was overrun by forces of the Houthi-Saleh alliance in late 2014. It is currently led by an eight-member Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) chaired by former Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi.

## Analysis and Recommendations

Yemen's economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict, which has led to a humanitarian crisis and a significant decline in economic activity. The data from the World Bank shows a contraction in GDP, high inflation, and a volatile exchange rate. The political instability, with the Houthi-controlled north and the IRG-controlled south, further complicates the economic landscape.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Humanitarian Aid:** Continued and increased humanitarian aid is crucial to address the immediate needs of the population.
*   **Economic Stabilization:** Efforts should be made to stabilize the currency and control inflation. This could involve support from international financial institutions.
*   **Peace and Security:** A lasting peace agreement is the most critical factor for economic recovery. International actors should continue to support peace negotiations.
*   **Infrastructure Development:** Investment in rebuilding infrastructure is essential for long-term economic growth.

## Data Sources and Methodology

*   **Data Source:** World Bank, ACLED
*   **Methodology:** The data was collected from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database and the ACLED website. The key economic indicators were extracted and compiled into a structured format. The timeline of major events was created based on information from ACLED.

## Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

*   **Key Finding:** The Yemeni economy is highly fragmented, with different economic conditions and policies in the north and south.
*   **Projection:** The economic outlook for Yemen remains bleak in the short term. Any significant recovery is contingent on a political settlement and a significant inflow of international aid and investment.
