# Yemen Economic Research Findings from ACAPS Reports

This document summarizes the key economic indicators, major events, and other relevant findings from the ACAPS Yemen reports.


## Key Findings from the November 2025 Report

*   **Food Insecurity:** Yemen is the third-most food-insecure country, with 18.1 million people projected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or above food insecurity between September 2025 and February 2026. An estimated 9.4 million people (27% of the population) are in areas at risk of experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) or above levels of food security.
*   **Exchange Rate:** The exchange rate has stabilized in Government of Yemen (GoY) controlled areas, with the Yemeni rial (YER) appreciating.
*   **Food Prices:** Food prices have seen a significant drop in GoY-controlled areas, reaching their lowest value since February 2024. However, in Ansar Allah (AA)-controlled areas, food prices remain high, with the US dollar (USD) value of food commodities being much higher than global prices.
*   **Fuel Prices:** In AA-controlled areas, average fuel prices in YER have not seen major fluctuations.
*   **Conflict:** There has been a considerable decline in conflict, with the lowest number of alerts in September since at least February 2024.
*   **Displacement:** Displacement alerts saw a slight increase in August and September compared to previous months.
*   **Food Imports:** Food import volumes through the southern ports (under GoY control) were the highest since January 2025, up 39% from the 12-month moving average and 121% higher year-on-year.

## Key Findings from the June 2025 Report

*   **Food Insecurity:** Between May–August 2025, nearly five million people (50% of the population) in Government of Yemen (GoY)-controlled areas of southern Yemen will face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and above levels of food insecurity, with 1.5 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4).
*   **Exchange Rate:** In April 2025, the monthly average exchange rate in GoY-controlled areas hit a new record high of YER 2,473 to USD 1, marking a 32% depreciation compared to April 2024. In contrast, the exchange rate in AA-controlled governorates remained largely stable at YER 537 to USD 1.
*   **Food Prices:** The minimum food basket (MFB) across most GoY governorates averaged YER 161,000 (USD 65), up 32% year-on-year due to currency depreciation. In contrast, AA-controlled areas kept MFB prices relatively stable at YER 47,000, though the USD cost remained higher at USD 88.

By July 2025, 15 million people (37.5% of the population) resided in areas at risk of deteriorating into IPC 4 or worse food insecurity levels. The IPC outlook for September 2025 to February 2026 projects that 18.1 million people (52% of the population) are likely to face acute food insecurity levels.
*   **Exchange Rate:** In July, the monthly average exchange rate in GoY areas reached YER 2,798 to USD 1, a 32% depreciation compared to July 2024. In AA areas, the exchange rate remained nearly fixed at YER 536 per USD 1.
*   **Food Prices:** In GoY areas, the average minimum food basket (MFB) cost reached YER 192,000 (USD 68), a 44% year-on-year increase. In AA areas, the MFB rose by 2.8%, reaching YER 47,320 (USD 88.6).

## Key Findings from the November 2024 Report

*   **Food Insecurity:** In September 2024, 52% of Yemeni households were employing severe food-coping strategies. 17.1 million people (49% of the population) will be in need of food assistance during 2025.
*   **Exchange Rate:** In October, the exchange rate in GoY-controlled areas depreciated to YER 1,927 to USD 1, a 24% depreciation compared to the same period in 2023. The exchange rate in AA-controlled governorates remained largely stable at YER 533 to USD 1.
*   **Food Prices:** The average price of the minimum food basket (MFB) in GoY-controlled areas reached YER 130,364 (USD 68) in October, 25% higher than the same month in 2023. In AA-controlled areas, the cost was YER 46,247 (USD 87), a 2% increase compared to the previous year.
*   **Fuel Prices:** The average price of diesel, petrol, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in GoY governorates increased by 2.4% this month compared to August 2024 and by 8.9% compared to October 2023. In AA-controlled areas, the average price of diesel, petrol, and LPG only increased slightly by 0.7% between August–October and 0.6% year-on-year.
*   **Conflict:** In October, the conflict indicator recorded 28 heightened risk alerts but no critical alerts.
*   **Displacement:** 263 households experienced displacement in October.
*   **Food Imports:** In October 2024, Yemen’s food imports totaled 472,690MT, a 30% decrease compared to September 2024, but a 12% increase compared to August.

## Key Findings from the Social Impact Overview 2022 Report

*   **Economic Conditions:** Worsening economic conditions remained a concern throughout 2022, despite the support packages that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates provided following the truce. Eight years of conflict had led to the increased use of potentially harmful economic coping strategies, such as selling off important and even productive assets.
*   **Migrant Workers:** The number of Yemeni migrant workers returning from the KSA also increased in 2022 as a result of changing immigration regulations and economic conditions in KSA.

## Key Findings from the Crisis Impact Overview 2020-2021 Report

*   **Economic Conditions:** Economic conditions in 2020 worsened because of the depreciation of the Yemeni rial, exchange rate diversion between the north and the south, a drop in foreign currency inflows, the continued depletion of the Saudi deposit, and reduced overseas aid and humanitarian funding to Yemen. These factors led to increased prices, making many items unaffordable for the majority of households.
*   **Exchange Rate:** The depreciation of the Yemeni rial continued to be a major concern, affecting purchasing power.
*   **Food Prices:** Increased food prices were a significant issue, driven by the depreciation of the currency and other economic factors.
*   **Displacement:** In 2020, thousands of people were displaced each month, often multiple times. This strained their resources and interfered with their ability to meet their own needs.
*   **Conflict:** Civilian casualties decreased from 3,224 in 2019 to 2,087 in 2020 (a decrease of 35%).

## Key Findings from the Crisis Impact Overview August-October 2019 Report

*   **Economic Warfare:** Economic rivalry between parties to the conflict resulted in fuel shortages, increasing the cost of transporting basic commodities and cutting health, water and sanitation services.
*   **Fuel Shortages:** Fuel shortages led to increased water and food prices, exacerbating food insecurity for vulnerable households.
*   **Conflict:** Conflict has generally been decreasing across the country. Monthly conflict events have been declining since March, mostly driven by a drop in shelling and airstrikes and a decrease in battle intensity.
*   **Civilian Casualties:** Civilian casualties have been decreasing since March. October 2019 saw the lowest number of civilian casualties in two years (106 civilian casualties).
