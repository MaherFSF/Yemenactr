# Yemen Economic Research: Microfinance and Financial Inclusion (2015-2026)

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Yemen's economy with a focus on microfinance and financial inclusion from 2015 to 2026, based on the World Bank's "Yemen Financial Market Infrastructure and Inclusion Project" report.

## 1. Key Economic Indicators and Statistics

According to the World Bank report, Yemen has experienced a severe economic crisis due to the ongoing conflict that began in 2015. Key economic indicators are as follows:

*   **GDP:** Between 2015 and 2024, Yemen's real GDP per capita contracted by a staggering 58%. The economy is estimated to have contracted by 1.5% in real terms in 2024, following a 2.0% decline in 2023.
*   **Exchange Rate:** The Yemeni Riyal (YER) has depreciated significantly. It went from 1,540 YER per US dollar at the end of 2023 to 2,560 by May 15, 2025.
*   **Inflation:** The depreciation of the YER has driven consumer prices up, straining household purchasing power.
*   **Trade:** Yemen is heavily reliant on imports, and the conflict has led to a current account deficit of 18% of GDP.
*   **Oil Production:** Oil production, a key source of revenue, dropped by 60% in 2023 and has stagnated since.

## 2. Major Events and Policy Decisions by Year (2015-2026)

The World Bank report highlights the following major events and their economic consequences:

*   **2015:** The civil war breaks out, leading to a severe economic crisis and the fragmentation of the country into two distinct economic zones with competing institutions.
*   **2015-2024:** The country experiences a 58% contraction in real GDP per capita. The conflict leads to a decline in hydrocarbon production, reduced agricultural output, and a deteriorating banking sector.
*   **2023:** Oil production drops by 60% due to a Houthi blockade on oil exports from IRG-controlled areas.
*   **2024:** The economy contracts by 1.5% in real terms. The oil blockade continues, and the current account deficit reaches 18% of GDP.
*   **2025:** The Yemeni Riyal depreciates to 2,560 per US dollar by May 15th. The World Bank proposes a US$20 million grant for the Yemen Financial Market Infrastructure and Inclusion Project.
*   **2025-2030:** The project aims to develop a payment infrastructure, increase financial inclusion, and support digital payment usage.


## 3. Analysis and Recommendations

The World Bank's analysis indicates that the conflict and resulting economic fragmentation are the primary drivers of Yemen's economic crisis. The lack of a functioning and interoperable payment system exacerbates the situation, hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid and impeding economic activity. The report's primary recommendation is the implementation of the Yemen Financial Market Infrastructure and Inclusion Project, which aims to:

*   Develop a Fast Payment System (FPS) and a Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system.
*   Support access to and usage of the new payments infrastructure.
*   Increase the volume of digital transactions and competition in the financial sector.
*   Enhance the usage of digital payments by individuals, merchants, and the government.

## 4. Data Sources and Methodology

The primary data source for this research is the World Bank's Project Appraisal Document for the "Yemen Financial Market Infrastructure and Inclusion Project" (Report No: PADHI00396), dated May 22, 2025. The methodology involved a thorough review of this document to extract key economic data, timelines, and project details related to Yemen's financial sector.

## 5. Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

The World Bank project is tailored to Yemen's unique context of conflict and economic fragmentation. Key findings and projections include:

*   **Financial Inclusion:** The project aims to increase financial inclusion by developing a payment infrastructure that supports digital transactions. The goal is to increase the volume of digital transactions and expand access to financial services for underserved populations, including women.
*   **Digital Payments:** The project will promote the use of digital payments for government-to-person (G2P) payments, such as cash transfers, which will reduce the time and distance beneficiaries have to travel to receive funds. The project will also incentivize merchants to adopt electronic payment systems.
*   **Economic Growth:** By improving the efficiency of payment transactions and increasing financial inclusion, the project is expected to contribute to greater economic growth and stability in Yemen.
*   **Projections:** The project is expected to be implemented between 2025 and 2030. The expected disbursements are projected to be $4.75 million in 2026, $5.00 million in 2027, $6.00 million in 2028, and $2.00 million in both 2029 and 2030.

## Conclusion

The World Bank's "Yemen Financial Market Infrastructure and Inclusion Project" provides a critical framework for addressing Yemen's severe economic challenges. The project's focus on developing a modern payment infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion is a crucial step towards stabilizing the economy, improving the delivery of humanitarian aid, and fostering long-term economic growth. The successful implementation of this project has the potential to significantly improve the lives of ordinary Yemenis and lay the foundation for a more resilient and inclusive economy.
