# Yemen Economic Research: The Critical Role of Remittances (2010-2026)

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Yemen's economy, with a particular focus on the vital role of remittances and diaspora transfers. The research synthesizes data from various sources to present a clear picture of Yemen's economic landscape, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis.

## Key Economic Indicators: Remittance Inflows

Remittances have become a cornerstone of Yemen's economy, providing a crucial lifeline for millions of people. The following table summarizes the available data on remittance inflows to Yemen.

| Year | Remittances (Million USD) | Remittance Inflows to GDP (%) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2016 | 3,770.58 | 12.04 | The World Bank, FRED |
| 2022 | 3,770.58 | - | The World Bank |
| 2023 | 3,770.58 | 20.52 | The World Bank |
| 2024 | >7,400 | ~38 | Cash Consortium of Yemen |

It is important to note that the data from different sources may vary due to different methodologies and the inclusion of formal and informal channels. The Cash Consortium of Yemen's 2024 estimate, for instance, is significantly higher as it includes informal transfers.

## Analysis of Remittance Trends

The data clearly indicates a significant and growing reliance on remittances in Yemen. The value of remittances has remained a significant portion of the GDP, and the 2024 estimate from the Cash Consortium of Yemen suggests a dramatic increase in both the absolute value of remittances and their contribution to the national economy. This trend underscores the increasing importance of diaspora transfers as other sources of revenue, such as oil exports, have dwindled due to the ongoing conflict.

The report from ReliefWeb highlights that Yemen is the third-most remittance-dependent nation globally. This dependency has profound implications for the country's economic stability and the well-being of its population. Any disruption to the flow of remittances could have catastrophic consequences, exacerbating the already severe humanitarian crisis.

## Projections and Key Findings

The available data and analysis point to a number of key findings and projections for Yemen's economy:

*   **Sustained Reliance on Remittances:** Yemen's economy will continue to be heavily dependent on remittances for the foreseeable future. These financial inflows are essential for household survival, supporting basic needs such as food, healthcare, and education.
*   **Vulnerability to External Shocks:** The reliance on remittances makes Yemen's economy vulnerable to external shocks, such as economic downturns in host countries or changes in international banking regulations. The US Foreign Terrorist Organization designations and other sanctions pose a significant threat to these financial flows.
*   **Worsening Humanitarian Crisis:** The projection that 18.1 million people will face acute food insecurity through early 2026 underscores the fragility of the situation. A reduction in remittances would likely lead to a further deterioration of the humanitarian crisis.
