**Key Economic Indicators and Statistics:**

*   **Real GDP Contraction:** Approximately 27% over the past decade.
*   **2024 GDP Contraction:** 1.5% due to falling oil and LPG production, exports, and domestic consumption.
*   **2025 Projected GDP Contraction:** 0.5%.
*   **Medium-Term Growth Projection (2026-2030):** Expected to gradually increase from 0.5% in 2026 to approximately 2.5% by 2030.
*   **Inflation:** 27% in 2024, rising above 35% year-on-year by July 2025.
*   **Government Revenues:** Declined from 22.5% of GDP in 2014 to below 12% in 2024.
*   **Public Debt:** Surged to over 100% of Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) GDP.
*   **Current Account Deficit:** Expanded from 2.1% of GDP in 2014 to almost 11% of GDP by 2024.
*   **International Reserve Coverage:** Less than one month of imports.

**Major Events and Policy Decisions:**

*   **2014:** Conflict began, halting a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement.
*   **2022:** Houthi attacks on oil facilities halted oil exports, making Yemen an oil importer.
*   **2023-2024:** Saudi Arabia provided about $2 billion in financial support.
*   **July 2025:** The government established a National Committee for the Regulation and Financing of Imports (NCRFI) to enhance import transparency and channel FX into the formal banking sector.
*   **August 2025:** FX stabilization measures were adopted by the IRG.
*   **September 2025:** Saudi Arabia announced a $368 million financing package for budget, energy, and health support.

**Analysis and Recommendations:**

*   The IMF welcomes the resumption of Article IV consultations with Yemen after an 11-year hiatus.
*   The IRG's policy response and regional partner support have lessened the economic impact of halted oil exports.
*   The outlook is cautiously optimistic, with moderate recovery expected over the medium term, but is subject to significant domestic and external risks.
*   The IMF recommends restoring fiscal sustainability through revenue mobilization, expenditure optimization, and engaging with creditors.
*   The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) should continue to focus on controlling inflation, maintaining a market-driven exchange rate, and ensuring financial integrity.
*   Substantial structural reforms are needed to unlock Yemen's economic potential, including strengthening institutions, improving governance, and reducing barriers to business activity.

**Data Sources and Methodology:**

*   The report is based on data provided by Yemeni authorities and analysis by IMF staff.

**Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections:**

*   Yemen is facing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
*   The halt in oil revenues has prompted tight policies from the IRG.
*   Public debt is unsustainable at over 100% of IRG GDP.
*   Additional external financial support is crucial for macroeconomic stability.


### 2013 Article IV Consultation (July 31, 2013)

**Key Economic Indicators and Statistics:**

*   **Real GDP Growth:** Contracted by over 12% in 2011, grew by 2.4% in 2012.
*   **Average Inflation:** Declined to 9.9% in 2012 from 19.5% in 2011.

**Major Events and Policy Decisions:**

*   The macroeconomic situation stabilized in 2012, but the recovery remained fragile.
*   Oil production declined further due to continued sabotage of pipelines.

**Analysis and Recommendations:**

*   The appreciation of the rial to its pre-crisis level, moderation of international food prices, and easing of supply shortages contributed to the decline in inflation.
