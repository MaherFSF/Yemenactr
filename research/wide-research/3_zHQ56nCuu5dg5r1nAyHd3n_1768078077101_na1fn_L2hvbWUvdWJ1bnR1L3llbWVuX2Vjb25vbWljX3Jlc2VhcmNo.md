**Author:** Manus AI

**Date:** January 10, 2026

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Yemen's economic and food security situation from 2015 to 2026. Drawing on data from the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), it examines key economic indicators, major events, and their collective impact on the Yemeni population. The findings reveal a catastrophic humanitarian crisis driven by protracted conflict, economic collapse, and a severe lack of funding for humanitarian aid. The report concludes with an analysis of the current situation and provides recommendations for the international community and stakeholders.

## 1. Key Economic Indicators and Statistics

Yemen's economy has been in a state of severe decline since the escalation of the conflict in 2015. This section presents key economic indicators that illustrate the depth of the crisis.

### 1.1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

The country's GDP has experienced a dramatic contraction. In 2015, the annual GDP growth rate plummeted to a record low of -30.50% [1]. While there have been minor fluctuations in subsequent years, the economy remains fragile. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the GDP annual growth rate was a mere 1.50% [1].

| Indicator             | Value     | Year      | Source                                    |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| GDP Annual Growth Rate | -30.50%   | 2015      | Trading Economics / CSO, Yemen [1]        |
| GDP Annual Growth Rate | 1.50%     | 2022      | Trading Economics / CSO, Yemen [1]        |
| Average GDP Growth    | 1.88%     | 1990-2022 | Trading Economics / CSO, Yemen [1]        |

### 1.2. Exchange Rates

The Yemeni Rial (YER) has seen significant depreciation and fragmentation. As of October 2025, the exchange rate varied drastically between different parts of the country. In areas controlled by the Internationally Recognized Government (IRG), the rate was YER 1,616/USD, while in areas under the Sana'a Based Authorities (SBA), it was YER 534/USD [2]. This fragmentation complicates trade and humanitarian operations.

### 1.3. Imports

Yemen is heavily reliant on imports for food and fuel. Between January and October 2025, food imports declined by 22% and fuel imports by 27% compared to the same period in 2024 [2]. This reduction in essential supplies has a direct impact on food availability and prices.

## 2. Major Events and Policy Decisions by Year

The following timeline highlights key events and decisions that have shaped Yemen's economic trajectory:

*   **2015:** The escalation of the conflict marked the beginning of a severe economic downturn and a protracted humanitarian crisis.
*   **2025:** A critical funding shortfall for humanitarian aid was reported, with the Yemen Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan only 24% funded as of mid-November [2].
*   **2026 (Projection):** The World Food Programme has announced that it will be forced to reduce food assistance in IRG-controlled areas from 3.4 million to 1.6 million people per cycle due to the severe funding shortages [2].

## 3. Analysis and Recommendations

### 3.1. Analysis

The data paints a grim picture of Yemen's economy. The ongoing conflict has shattered the country's productive capacity, leading to a collapse in GDP and widespread poverty. The population is caught in a vicious cycle of economic decline and food insecurity. The high dependency on aid, coupled with a fragmented and depreciating currency, has left the majority of Yemenis vulnerable to shocks. The reduction in humanitarian funding is a critical threat that will undoubtedly lead to a further deterioration of the crisis, with the most vulnerable populations, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), facing the gravest risks.

### 3.2. Recommendations

Addressing Yemen's complex crisis requires a multi-faceted approach:

1.  **Urgent and Sustained Humanitarian Funding:** The international community must immediately increase and sustain funding for the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan to prevent a catastrophic famine.
2.  **Economic Stabilization:** Efforts must be made to stabilize the Yemeni Rial and address the fragmented exchange rate system. This could involve technical support to the central banks and the establishment of a mechanism for managing foreign exchange.
3.  **Support for the Private Sector:** Revitalizing the private sector is essential for long-term economic recovery. This includes supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and facilitating trade.
4.  **Peace and Political Stability:** Ultimately, a lasting solution to Yemen's economic and humanitarian crisis can only be achieved through a peaceful and inclusive political settlement.

## 4. Data Sources and Methodology

This report is based on a comprehensive review of publicly available data from the following sources:

*   **World Food Programme (WFP):** The WFP's food security assessments and regular updates provide critical on-the-ground information on food consumption, market prices, and the impact of the crisis on households [2].
*   **Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC):** The IPC provides a standardized framework for classifying the severity and magnitude of food insecurity. Its analysis and projections are essential for understanding the scale of the crisis [3].
*   **Trading Economics:** This source provides historical data on key economic indicators, including GDP growth rates, which are used to contextualize the current crisis [1].

The methodology for this report involved the collection, synthesis, and analysis of the data from these sources to provide a holistic and up-to-date overview of Yemen's economic situation.

## 5. Yemen-Specific Findings and Projections

The food security situation in Yemen is dire and is projected to worsen.

*   **Current Food Insecurity:** Between May and August 2025, over 17 million people were classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above. This includes 5.2 million people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 11.9 million in IPC Phase 3 [3].
*   **Projected Food Insecurity:** The situation is projected to deteriorate between September 2025 and February 2026, with 18.1 million people (52% of the population) expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above. This includes an estimated 41,000 people who will face catastrophic levels of hunger (IPC Phase 5) [3].
*   **Economic Strain on Households:** The economic crisis has a direct impact on the daily lives of Yemenis. The average household spends over 70% of its income on food, leaving little for other essential needs [2].
