## Detailed Findings by Year

### 2024: A Nation at a Crossroads

In early 2024, Yemen stood at a critical juncture. After nine years of conflict, the nation's economy was in a state of severe deterioration, with widespread damage to infrastructure and a collapse of basic services [4]. A truce in 2023 brought a fragile respite, leading to a significant reduction in conflict-related casualties. However, localized violence persisted, and the pervasive threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance continued to endanger civilians and impede recovery efforts [4].

### 2025: Deepening Crisis and Funding Gaps

The humanitarian situation in 2025 is characterized by a significant funding shortfall. The **Yemen Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan** for the year requires **$2.48 billion**, with a prioritized need of **$1.42 billion** for the most urgent interventions [1]. As of the latest reports, the plan is only **27.8% funded**, with **$688 million** received against the total requirement. This leaves a staggering **$1.79 billion** in unmet needs [1]. The **Food Security and Agriculture** cluster is the most underfunded, with a requirement of **$1.1 billion** and only **21.7%** of the necessary funds secured [1].

### 2016: Escalating Needs Amidst Conflict

The **2016 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan** highlighted the escalating humanitarian crisis, with a total funding requirement of **$1.63 billion** [2]. The plan was **62.9% funded**, with **$1.03 billion** received, leaving a gap of **$606.5 million** [2]. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia were the top donors [2]. The **Food Security and Agriculture** cluster had the largest financial requirement, at **$746 million**, of which **62.2%** was funded [2].

### 2015: The Onset of a Deeper Crisis

The **2015 Yemen Strategic Response Plan** was launched with a requirement of **$1.60 billion** to address the growing humanitarian needs [3]. The plan was **54.6% funded**, with **$874.2 million** in contributions, resulting in a shortfall of **$726.6 million** [3]. The primary donors were the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom [3]. The **Food Security** cluster represented the largest portion of the appeal, with a requirement of **$791.9 million**, of which only **35.1%** was funded [3].

## Analysis and Recommendations

The data reveals a consistent and alarming trend of underfunding for Yemen's humanitarian response, despite the escalating needs. The funding shortfalls, particularly in critical sectors like food security, have severe consequences for the civilian population. The reliance on a few major donors also poses a risk to the sustainability of the humanitarian effort. It is recommended that the international community redouble its efforts to fully fund the humanitarian response plans, diversify the donor base, and prioritize sustainable solutions that address the root causes of the crisis, including the economic collapse and the ongoing conflict.

## Data Sources and Methodology

This report is based on data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service (FTS) and official OCHA reports. The FTS provides comprehensive data on humanitarian funding flows, which has been used to analyze the funding status of Yemen's humanitarian response plans. The analysis focuses on the years 2015, 2016, and 2025, for which complete data was available through the FTS platform. The 2024 data is based on the Humanitarian Needs Overview, which provides a qualitative assessment of the economic situation.
