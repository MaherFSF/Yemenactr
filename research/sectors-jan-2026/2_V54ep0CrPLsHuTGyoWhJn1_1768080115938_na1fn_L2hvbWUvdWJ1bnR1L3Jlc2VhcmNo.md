## Conflict Impact

The conflict that began in 2015 has had a devastating impact on Yemen's labor market. The economy has shrunk by more than half, with real GDP per capita falling by 54%. This has led to widespread job losses and a surge in unemployment. The private sector has been severely affected, with many businesses closing down or scaling back operations. The public sector has also been crippled, with the irregular payment of salaries becoming a major issue. The conflict has created a humanitarian crisis, with over 60% of the population facing food insecurity. The war has also exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, particularly for youth and women, who face even greater challenges in finding employment.

## Current Status January 2026

As of January 2026, Yemen's labor market remains in a precarious state. The unemployment rate is high, particularly among the youth. The ongoing conflict and political fragmentation continue to hinder economic recovery. The division of the country into areas controlled by the IRG and the Houthis has created two distinct economic systems, with different currencies, exchange rates, and regulatory environments. This fragmentation further complicates efforts to create jobs and improve livelihoods. The humanitarian crisis persists, with millions of Yemenis dependent on aid. The outlook for the labor market in the near term is bleak, with any significant improvement contingent on a lasting peace agreement and a comprehensive reconstruction effort.

## Aden vs Sana'a Differences

The economic systems in Aden (IRG-controlled) and Sana'a (DFA-controlled) have diverged significantly. The IRG government in Aden has struggled with a sharp decline in revenues due to the Houthi blockade on oil exports, leading to a depreciation of the Yemeni Rial in the Aden market. In contrast, the Houthis in Sana'a have established their own revenue-collection systems, including taxes and customs, but have not consistently used these funds to pay public sector salaries. The ban on new banknotes in Houthi-controlled areas has created a currency divide, with different exchange rates prevailing in the two regions. This economic fragmentation has created significant challenges for businesses and individuals operating across the divide.
