# Research Findings: Yemen's Investment & Private Sector

This document summarizes the key findings of the research on Yemen's investment and private sector from 2010 to January 2026.

## Key Statistics

*   **GDP Decline:** Yemen's GDP contracted by over 50% between 2014 and 2020 (World Bank, 2024).
*   **FDI:** Foreign Direct Investment has been negligible since 2015, with most international firms ceasing operations (World Bank, 2024).
*   **SMEs:** Over 95% of Yemeni firms are micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), largely informal and unbanked (World Bank, 2024).
*   **Financial Inclusion:** Only 5% of the population and firms are banked, and only 1% of women have bank accounts (World Bank, 2024).
*   **Unemployment:** The conflict has led to a massive increase in unemployment, with estimates suggesting it exceeds 50% in some areas (World Bank, 2024).
*   **Corruption:** Yemen consistently ranks among the most corrupt countries in the world, posing a major obstacle to investment (Transparency International, as cited in World Bank, 2024).
*   **Trade:** Exports of goods and services declined by about 81.3% in 2020 compared to 2014 (World Bank, 2024).

## Major Events and Policy Changes

*   **2011:** Arab Spring uprising in Yemen leads to political instability and economic decline.
*   **2014:** Houthi forces take control of Sana'a, the capital, escalating the conflict.
*   **2015:** A Saudi-led coalition intervenes in Yemen, marking a major turning point in the conflict. The ensuing years are marked by a deepening economic crisis, with the private sector severely affected by the blockade, airstrikes, and internal conflict.
*   **2016:** The Central Bank of Yemen splits into two rival institutions, one in Sana'a under Houthi control and one in Aden recognized by the internationally recognized government (IRG). This exacerbates the financial crisis and creates a dual-system that complicates business operations.
*   **2018:** The Stockholm Agreement is signed, but fails to bring a lasting peace. The economic situation continues to deteriorate.
*   **2022:** A UN-brokered truce provides a temporary respite, but the underlying economic and political challenges remain.
*   **2024:** The World Bank releases a report highlighting the resilience of the Yemeni private sector, but also the immense challenges it faces, calling for urgent reforms to support its recovery.

## Conflict Impact

The conflict has had a devastating impact on Yemen's investment and private sector. The blockade and restrictions on trade have crippled import-dependent businesses, leading to shortages of essential goods and soaring prices. Airstrikes and fighting have destroyed critical infrastructure, including factories, roads, and ports. The collapse of the banking system and the split of the Central Bank have made it nearly impossible for businesses to access finance. The business environment is characterized by extreme uncertainty, insecurity, and a high risk of extortion and predation by armed groups. Many businesses have been forced to close, and those that remain operate at a fraction of their capacity. The conflict has also led to a massive brain drain, with many skilled professionals and entrepreneurs leaving the country.

## Aden vs Sana'a Differences

The split of the Central Bank and the emergence of two competing authorities have created a fragmented economic landscape. In Aden, the IRG has attempted to implement economic reforms and attract foreign aid, but has been hampered by corruption and limited capacity. The business environment in Aden is characterized by a mix of formal and informal actors, with a growing presence of businesses linked to the IRG. In Sana'a, the DFA has established a de facto government and has been able to maintain a degree of order and provide some basic services. However, the business environment in Sana'a is highly constrained by the conflict and international sanctions. Businesses in Sana'a face difficulties in accessing foreign currency and are subject to a complex and often arbitrary system of taxation and regulation.

## Current Status (January 2026)

As of January 2026, Yemen's economy remains in a precarious state. The conflict continues to be the primary driver of economic instability, with a projected real GDP decline of 1.5% for 2026 and a projected inflation rate of 20.4% (IMF, 2026). The humanitarian crisis is worsening due to funding shortfalls for aid operations (UN News, 2026). The private sector, while showing some resilience, is operating in an extremely challenging environment. The political and security situation remains volatile, with the UN Security Council holding regular briefings on the matter. There are some signs of government efforts to engage with the private sector, but the overall outlook remains bleak without a lasting political settlement.
