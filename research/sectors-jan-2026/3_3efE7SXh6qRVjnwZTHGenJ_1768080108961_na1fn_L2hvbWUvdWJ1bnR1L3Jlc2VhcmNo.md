This document contains research findings on Yemen's Agriculture and Rural Development sector from 2010 to January 2026.



## World Bank: Breaking the Cycle of Food Crises in Yemen (May 2023)

*   **Food Insecurity:** An estimated 17 million people (around 60% of the population) faced acute food insecurity as of March 2023.
*   **Domestic Production:** Yemen’s agriculture sector supplies only 15-20% of its staple food needs.
*   **Conflict Impact:** The protracted conflict (8 years as of May 2023) has eroded agricultural assets, exacerbated by distorting agricultural policies, pest outbreaks (desert locusts), and frequent droughts and floods.
*   **Climate Change:** Poses significant risks, with heavy rains and flash floods causing damage to infrastructure and crops, while water shortages and outdated farming techniques affect crop resilience.
*   **World Bank Intervention:** The World Bank is providing financing to support agricultural production, climate-resilient restoration of productive assets, and scaling-up household-level food production.
*   **Data Initiative:** A new Joint Monitoring Report (JMR) is being developed in collaboration with FAO, OCHA, UNICEF, UNDP, WFP, and others to provide quarterly updates on food security data, which will be integrated into the Global Alliance for Food Security's Food and Nutrition Security Dashboard.

## FAO: Family Farming in Yemen

*   **Economic Contribution:** Agriculture accounts for about 15% of GDP and employs over 50% of the total workforce.
*   **Livelihoods:** It is a significant source of livelihood through production and breeding, and a large portion of non-oil domestic exports.
*   **Water Scarcity:** The country is heavily dependent on rainfall, which varies significantly across regions. Rainfed agriculture is the dominant practice, covering approximately 50% of cultivated land.

## ACAPS: Yemen Joint Monitoring Report (August 2025)

*   **Food Security (May-August 2025):** 17.1 million people (49% of the population) were projected to face acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse).
*   **IPC Outlook (September 2025 - February 2026):** 18.1 million people (52% of the population) are likely to face acute food insecurity.
*   **Food Consumption (June 2025):** 67% of households nationwide experienced inadequate food consumption. In Government of Yemen (GoY) controlled areas, 70% of households could not meet minimum food needs, while in Ansar Allah (AA) controlled areas, it was 66%.
*   **Split System Differences:** The report highlights significant differences in food security, consumption, and economic indicators between GoY and AA controlled areas. For instance, in July 2025, the exchange rate in GoY areas was YER 2,798 per USD, while in AA areas it was fixed at YER 536 per USD. The Minimum Food Basket (MFB) cost was YER 192,000 (USD 68) in GoY areas and YER 47,320 (USD 88.6) in AA areas.
*   **Drought (June 2025):** Severe rainfall deficits (10-60% below normal) and high temperatures stressed cropland, particularly in the highlands, likely reducing yields and impacting livestock.
*   **Food Imports (July 2025):** Total food imports were 268,000MT, a 33% decrease from July 2024. Imports through Red Sea ports (AA-controlled) were down 37% year-on-year, while imports through Southern ports (GoY-controlled) were down 22% year-on-year.
