## 4. Conflict Impact

The conflict that escalated in 2015 has had a devastating impact on prices and the cost of living in Yemen. The division of the Central Bank in 2016 created a dual monetary system, with different exchange rates and policies in IRG and DFA controlled areas, leading to significant price disparities. The blockade and damage to infrastructure, particularly the Red Sea ports, have severely constrained the import of essential goods like food and fuel, leading to shortages and price hikes. The WFP reported a 13% decline in food imports and a 28% decline in fuel imports through Red Sea ports between January and November 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This has resulted in a severe food crisis, with 61% of households unable to meet their minimum food needs as of November 2025. The conflict has also led to a collapse in livelihoods and a sharp decline in purchasing power, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

## 5. Current Status January 2026

As of January 2026, the cost of living in Yemen remains extremely high, although there has been some recent stabilization in IRG-controlled areas. The average monthly net salary is approximately 69,972 ﷼, which is insufficient to cover the basic needs of a family. A meal at an inexpensive restaurant costs around 1,908 ﷼, and a liter of gasoline is priced at 737 ﷼. The exchange rate in IRG areas has stabilized at around 1,616 YER/USD, which has contributed to a 20% year-over-year decrease in the cost of the minimum food basket. However, the situation remains dire, with a significant portion of the population facing food insecurity. The humanitarian response is severely underfunded, with the 2025 Yemen Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan only 24% funded as of December 2025.

## 6. Aden vs Sana'a Differences

The split in the central banking system has created significant economic divergence between the IRG-controlled areas (Aden) and the DFA-controlled areas (Sana'a). The severity of hunger is notably higher in SBA areas, with 32% of households facing moderate to severe hunger compared to 25% in IRG areas. More households in SBA areas (66%) resort to crisis or emergency coping strategies compared to IRG areas (58%). The IRG has managed to stabilize the exchange rate in its territories, leading to a reduction in food prices. In contrast, the DFA-controlled areas continue to face more severe constraints on imports and a more volatile economic environment. This has resulted in a greater number of people in need in SBA areas, where humanitarian assistance has been suspended.
