## Conflict Impact

The conflict that began in 2015 has had a devastating impact on Yemen's humanitarian sector. It has led to a severe economic crisis, with a significant decline in GDP, rampant inflation, and a collapse of public services. The conflict has also directly impacted aid delivery, with both sides of the conflict imposing restrictions on humanitarian access. The ACAPS analysis highlights a "Complex crisis" with a "Very High" severity level and maximum "Access constraints" (5.0/5.0). The conflict has also led to the displacement of millions of people, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The constant threat of violence and the destruction of infrastructure have made it extremely difficult for aid agencies to operate effectively and reach those most in need.

## Current Status (January 2026)

As of January 2026, Yemen is facing a convergence of conflict, economic decline, and climate shocks, which continue to exacerbate humanitarian needs. The economy remains extremely fragile, with high inflation eroding the purchasing power of ordinary Yemenis. Over 18 million people are acutely food insecure, and the health system is on the verge of collapse. The lack of funding for the humanitarian response is a major concern, with only a fraction of the required funds being met. The operating environment for aid agencies remains extremely challenging, with increasing restrictions on access and a growing number of attacks on humanitarian workers.

## Aden vs Sana'a Differences

The split between the IRG-controlled areas (Aden) and the DFA-controlled areas (Sana'a) has created significant differences in the humanitarian situation and the operating environment for aid agencies.

*   **IRG-controlled areas (Aden):** Households are facing mounting economic hardship due to inflation and the depreciation of the currency. The government has been forced to implement spending cuts, which has disrupted public services and delayed salary payments to civil servants.
*   **DFA-controlled areas (Sana'a):** These areas have been affected by airstrikes on key ports, sanctions, and import restrictions, which have disrupted markets and led to shortages of food, fuel, and electricity. The DFA has also imposed significant restrictions on humanitarian access, including detaining aid workers and interfering with aid delivery.
