## ACAPS Report: Sea, Air, and Land Embargo (November 2017)

- **Date:** 15 November 2017
- **Event:** On 6 November 2017, the Saudi-led military coalition announced a temporary closure of all Yemen's airports, seaports, and land crossings, effectively halting access to commercial and humanitarian goods for 27 million people.
- **Context:** This was in response to a Houthi missile launched from Yemen targeting Riyadh airport on 4 November 2017. This was an addition to the naval blockade that had been in place for the previous 2.5 years.
- **Impact on Ports:**
    - Hodeidah and Saleef ports, which are under Houthi control, process 80% of commercial and humanitarian imports but remained closed.
    - Government-controlled ports in Aden, Mokha, and Mukalla could not substitute for the main ports due to limited offload and storage capacity.
- **Humanitarian Impact:**
    - The blockade was very likely to cause severe and rapid deterioration in the humanitarian situation.
    - The price of trucked water in Sana'a increased by 133% since the blockade began, largely due to fuel shortages.
    - The increased cost of water was likely to result in the use of unsafe water sources as people are unable to afford higher prices.

## Human Rights Watch Report: Aden Electricity and Water Cuts (November 2023)

- **Date:** 16 November 2023
- **Key Issue:** The Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) are failing to provide adequate electricity and water to residents of Aden, the provisional capital.
- **Impact on Population:**
    - Frequent and prolonged water and electricity shutoffs negatively affect residents' rights to health, education, and an adequate standard of living.
    - Many residents receive water from the public network only once every two or three days, or not at all.
    - In the summer of 2023, publicly supplied electricity was available for only a few hours a day, leading to dangerous conditions in the extreme heat.
    - The lack of electricity disrupts education, making it difficult for students to learn and for teachers to teach.
    - Health clinics, including emergency obstetrics units, are severely impacted, relying on private generators and donor support to function.
- **Split-System Dynamics:**
    - The STC has de facto control over Aden, including over electricity and water, but denies responsibility.
    - The Yemeni government, which is in a coalition with the STC, has also failed to fulfill its obligations.
    - A Yemeni government House of Representatives report in August 2023 found "widespread corruption" in the Electricity Ministry.
- **Protests and Repression:**
    - Protests over the lack of services have been met with force by STC security forces, including the use of live ammunition against protesters.

## UNDP: Lighting the Path to Recovery with Renewable Energy in Yemen (January 2025)

- **Date:** 26 January 2025
- **Energy Crisis:**
    - Access to energy in Yemen was limited before the conflict and has worsened since.
    - Most households struggle with irregular access to electricity and ongoing power outages.
    - The high price of diesel has made regular electricity access unaffordable for many.
    - The lack of reliable electricity impacts hospitals, schools, businesses, and water systems.
- **Renewable Energy Initiatives (ERRY Joint Programme III):
**
    - Over 164 public service facilities (schools, healthcare centers, etc.) have received solar energy equipment since 2023, benefiting nearly 200,000 people.
    - 98 schools have benefited from solar power, improving the learning environment.
    - 54 healthcare facilities have been equipped with solar energy systems, enabling them to store medicines and operate equipment.
    - A hybrid mini-grid plant (solar and wind) in Taiz Governorate generates 200kW of electricity, powering local markets.
- **Impact:**
    - The installed solar systems are projected to reduce 560 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.
    - The hybrid mini-grid is projected to reduce 72 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.
