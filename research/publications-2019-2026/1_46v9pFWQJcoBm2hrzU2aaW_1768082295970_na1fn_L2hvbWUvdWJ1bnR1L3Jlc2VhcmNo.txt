Inflation sharply eroded household purchasing power in IRG-controlled areas. Declining aid flows and dwindling foreign currency reserves weighed heavily on imports and consumption. The IRG’s fiscal position deteriorated further, with revenues declining by 30% year-on-year in the first half of 2025. External imbalances intensified, with the Yemeni rial weakening sharply. International aid has declined sharply. Food insecurity has reached alarming levels. Real GDP is projected to contract by 1.5% in 2025.
