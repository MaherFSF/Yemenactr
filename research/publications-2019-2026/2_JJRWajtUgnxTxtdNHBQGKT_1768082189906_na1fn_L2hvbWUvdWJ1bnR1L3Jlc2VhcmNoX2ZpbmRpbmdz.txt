Publication Date: 4 January 2026
Key Findings: In 2025, Yemen’s humanitarian response faced unprecedented funding shortfalls, with the Yemen Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan funded at only 25 per cent. This has forced all clusters to scale back critical services despite escalating needs. Yemen’s fragile health system is deteriorating rapidly as reduced funding and operational constraints threaten the continuity of care amid widespread food insecurity and malnutrition, poor water and sanitation conditions and disease outbreaks.
