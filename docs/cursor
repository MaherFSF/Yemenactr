Yemenactr — Cursor Master Execution Contract (YETO Role‑Intelligence)

**Ultimate objective:** make the Yemenactr repo ship a **production‑ready, decision‑grade YETO platform** that is:
- **Evidence‑only** (no fabricated numbers, no “demo” metrics)
- **Provenance‑complete** (every claim traces to a source + raw object)
- **Bilingual EN + AR** with true RTL/LTR parity
- **Split‑system safe** for Yemen (Aden/IRG vs Sana’a/DFA never merged)
- **Governance‑safe** (licensing compliant, corrections log, neutral language)

This contract is designed for:
- **Cursor Agent (Sonnet 4.5)**
- **Cursor Pro Plus**
- **GitHub PR workflow + Bugbot pre‑merge review**

## 1) Project anchors

**Repo (authoritative):** `MaherFSF/Yemenactr` (GitHub)

**Production:** `https://yeto.causewaygrp.com`

**Preview:** `https://d15ji3mnetzxh7.cloudfront.net/`

**Time coverage:** `2010‑01‑01 → today`, daily spine + historical vintages where available.

**Languages:** Arabic + English (Arabic is first‑class RTL, not a translation afterthought).

**Key asset shipped with this pack:** `data/source_registry/YETO_Sources_Universe_Master_PRODUCTION_READY_v2_0.xlsx`

---

## 2) What “production‑ready” means for YETO

Production‑ready here does **not** mean “it loads” or “it looks nice”. It means:

### A) Trust & governance
- Every number and claim is backed by **Evidence Packs**.
- Evidence packs expose provenance: `source_id → raw_object → ingestion_run → dataset_version → observation`.
- Yemen dual‑authority constraints are enforced everywhere via `regime_tag`.
- Corrections and revisions are tracked (change log).
- Licensing and access constraints are enforced (no ToS violations).

### B) Reliability & ops
- CI is green; no hidden “manual” steps.
- The system has deterministic migrations and deterministic backfills.
- A “Release Gate” admin page shows **PASS/FAIL** for every gate.

### C) UX quality
- EN/AR parity (routes, nav, tooltips, exports).
- RTL typography works (charts, labels, tables).
- Exports work and are evidence‑linked.

## 3) Execution mode

### Zero‑drift rule
Cursor Agent must behave like a disciplined engineering team, not a chat.

**NO DRIFT:** do not rewrite the stack, re‑architect unrelated components, or refactor for style.

### No‑questions default (with one safety valve)
Default: **do not ask the operator questions.**
If blocked or unknown:
1) create a gap ticket in `docs/GAP_TICKETS.md`;
2) proceed with the safest compliant default;
3) log the decision in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Safety valve:** Cursor may ask for confirmation only if an action is **irreversible** (destructive migration, deleting data) or requires **privileged secrets**.

---

## 4) Non‑negotiable laws

These rules are absolute. If any is violated, the build is considered broken.

### L1 — Evidence‑only / zero fabrication
- No number, chart point, recommendation, or alert may be displayed unless it has:
  - a provenance chain; and
  - a “Show Evidence” path.
- If missing evidence: show a **Gap Card** and create a gap ticket.

### L2 — Provenance chain is mandatory
Every observation must trace:
`observation → series → dataset_version → ingestion_run → raw_object → source_id`.

### L3 — Split‑system enforcement
- Never merge Aden/IRG and Sana’a/DFA indicators.
- Use `regime_tag` everywhere and support “Comparison Mode”.

### L4 — Quality & uncertainty disclosure
- Display uncertainty/quality only if derived from metadata or explicit source publication.
- Never invent confidence intervals.

### L5 — Licensing & access compliance
- Do **not** bypass paywalls, logins, robots, ToS.
- If a source needs partnership/API keys: create a gap ticket + admin outbox entry.

### L6 — Do‑no‑harm, privacy, neutrality
- No PII.
- No operationally harmful details.
- Neutral language.
- No sanction‑evasion guidance.

### L7 — Bilingual parity
- Every route/feature/export exists in EN and AR.
- Arabic is RTL, glossary‑governed.

### L8 — No fake UI / no placeholders
- No hardcoded “demo numbers” anywhere.
- If data missing: show Gap Card.

### L9 — GitHub + CI are the release gate
- No merge to `main` if CI is red.

---

## 5) GitHub workflow discipline

### Branch rules
- Every Cursor run happens on a **new branch**.
- Prefer branch names:
  - `fix/schema-v25-<date>`
  - `feat/release-gate-admin`
  - `feat/vip-rbac`
  - `feat/evidence-drawer`

### PR rules
Every PR must include:
- Summary (what changed)
- Evidence (how you verified)
- Risk/rollback notes
- Follow-ups (if any)

### Bugbot
- Bugbot should review every PR before merge.
- Do not enable “autofix” until after the repo stabilizes.

---

## 6) Core object model (must exist in code)

- **Role**: RBAC identity controlling dashboard + agent persona.
- **Module**: reusable dashboard block.
- **Evidence Pack**: UI + machine‑readable artifact proving a claim.
- **Alert**: structured event produced by rules/anomaly detection; never narrative‑only.
- **Brief**: a professional report built from alerts + evidence packs.
- **Confidence**: derived from metadata, not model vibes.

---

## 7) Phased delivery plan (STOP gates)

Each phase must end with a PR. Each PR must be mergeable.

### Phase 0 — Repo baseline + blockers map
**Deliverables:**
- `docs/ROUTE_INVENTORY.md` (initial pass/fail)
- `docs/RELEASE_GATES.md` (gates defined)
- `docs/BLOCKERS.md` updated

**STOP gate:** a single source of truth exists for what is broken and why.

### Phase 1 — Resolve schema/CI blockers (governance‑safe)
**Deliverables:**
- additive migrations
- schema definitions updated
- CI failure messages are actionable
- docs: `docs/SCHEMA_V2_5.md` and `docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`

**STOP gate:** CI gates pass once migrations applied.

### Phase 2 — Release Gate Admin + Playwright route inventory
**Deliverables:**
- `/admin/release-gate` page
- Playwright critical journeys
- CI artifact report (html)

**STOP gate:** release gate shows meaningful PASS/FAIL with links to evidence.

### Phase 3 — RBAC + VIP routing
**Deliverables:**
- typed roles
- server‑side enforcement (tRPC/route middleware)
- `/vip` router that sends each VIP to their dashboard

**STOP gate:** cross‑role access is denied by server, not by UI.

### Phase 4 — Dashboard module system + Evidence Drawer
**Deliverables:**
- reusable modules
- “Show Evidence” drawer
- evidence coverage meter

**STOP gate:** at least 3 modules render real evidence packs in EN/AR.

### Phase 5 — Role dashboards (minimum 5)
- President
- Finance Minister
- CBY Governor
- CBY Deputy Governor
- Donor

**STOP gate:** all five dashboards exist, evidence‑enabled, bilingual.

### Phase 6 — Alerts + briefs (S3)
**Deliverables:**
- alert rules + events
- brief generator
- S3 signed URLs

**STOP gate:** a test alert generates a brief and downloads.

### Phase 7 — Evidence‑only assistant
**Deliverables:**
- evidence‑only retrieval
- citation coverage gate
- role agent registry

**STOP gate:** 10 test questions answered with citations or “insufficient evidence”.

### Phase 8 — Performance + accessibility + hardening
**Deliverables:**
- Lighthouse/perf targets
- RTL/keyboard nav checks
- final release gate PASS

**STOP gate:** release gate PASS across all gates.

## 8) How to run Cursor “like a production team”

### A) Use repo‑native rules
Commit the `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` from this pack into the repo. They enforce the laws.

### B) Use slash commands
Commit `.cursor/commands/*.md` and run them by typing `/` in Cursor Agent.

### C) Each run produces one PR
- 1 objective
- 1 PR
- green CI

---

## 9) Current situation (based on your latest screenshots)

- **BLOCKER 2 (.env.example) is resolved** (good).
- **BLOCKER 1 (schema v2.5 missing columns) is the main remaining gate**.

Next action: run the `/schema-v25-governance-safe` command and open the PR.

---

## 10) Done means “boring reliability”

The platform is done when:
- New data ingests safely with provenance.
- Backfills are deterministic.
- Corrections are logged.
- VIP dashboards are gated correctly.
- Every number has evidence.
- CI + release gate make it impossible to ship garbage.
