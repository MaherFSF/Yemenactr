# Homepage Review - January 30, 2026

## Current Layout Analysis

The homepage has the following sections (top to bottom):
1. **Header/Navigation** - Green navbar with YETO logo, menu items
2. **Insights Ticker** - Scrolling economic data updates
3. **Hero Section** - Background image with KPI cards (GDP, Inflation, Exchange Rate)
4. **Sector Grid** - 16 sector cards with images
5. **Data Sources Bar** - "World Bank | IMF | UN OCHA | WFP | CBY | +170 مصدر"
6. **Exchange Rate Chart** - Interactive chart with time period tabs
7. **Latest Updates Section** - 6 news cards with images (آخر التحديثات)
8. **Platform Tools & Features** - 6 colorful feature cards
9. **CTA Section** - "Start exploring Yemen economic data" with buttons
10. **Footer** - Dark green with links and CauseWay attribution

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Blue Color in Latest Updates
- The "Latest Updates" section title appears to be using green (#1B5E20) already
- Need to verify all blue colors (#1e3a5f) are replaced with green

### 2. Resources Section with Scattered Logos
- Looking at the page, I don't see a "Resources" section with scattered logos
- The "Data Sources Bar" shows text links: World Bank | IMF | UN OCHA | WFP | CBY
- This appears clean and professional
- User may be referring to a different section - need clarification

### 3. Download Buttons on Methodology Page
- Current URLs are placeholders: /docs/YETO_Methodology_Guide_v1.0.pdf
- Files don't exist - need to create actual downloadable documents

### 4. Dynamic Updates
- Latest Updates section shows static data from January 10, 2026
- Need to wire to database for real-time updates

## Next Steps
1. Create actual PDF/XLSX files for Methodology page downloads
2. Wire Latest Updates to fetch from database
3. Verify all blue colors are replaced with green
4. Clarify with user about "Resources section with scattered logos"
