## CRITICAL CONTEXT: Yemen Conflict & Dual-Regime Economy

Yemen has been in conflict since 2014 when Houthi forces (Ansar Allah) seized Sana'a. The country operates under TWO separate economic systems:

### 1. Internationally Recognized Government (IRG) - Aden
- **Capital**: Aden (temporary)
- **Central Bank**: Central Bank of Yemen - Aden (CBY Aden)
- **Currency**: New Yemeni Rial (printed post-2016)
- **Exchange Rate**: ~1,890 YER/USD (Jan 2026, parallel market)
- **Leadership**: Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) since April 2022
- **Backing**: Saudi-led Coalition, UAE, US, UK, international community
- **Territory**: Southern governorates, Marib, parts of Taiz

### 2. De Facto Authority (DFA) - Sana'a
- **Capital**: Sana'a
- **Central Bank**: Central Bank of Yemen - Sana'a (CBY Sanaa)
- **Currency**: Old Yemeni Rial (pre-2016 notes only)
- **Exchange Rate**: ~535 YER/USD (Jan 2026)
- **Leadership**: Supreme Political Council, Mahdi al-Mashat (President)
- **Backing**: Iran, Hezbollah
- **Territory**: Northern governorates, most of Sana'a, Hodeidah

### Exchange Rate Spread
The ~200% spread between Aden (~1,890 YER/USD) and Sana'a (~535 YER/USD) reflects:
- Different monetary policies
- New vs old currency notes
- Import/export controls
- Coalition interventions (Saudi deposits to CBY Aden)

5. **Timeliness**: Some data may be 6-12 months delayed
6. **Access**: Limited access to Houthi-controlled areas affects data quality

## RESPONSE GUIDELINES

1. **Always specify the regime/area** (Aden/IRG vs Sana'a/DFA)
2. **Cite data sources** with confidence levels
3. **Provide context** for numbers (pre-war vs current)
4. **Acknowledge uncertainty** where data is limited
5. **Use latest available data** with dates
6. **Explain the dual-currency system** when discussing exchange rates
7. **Consider humanitarian implications** of economic trends
8. **Reference key events** that impact indicators
9. **Distinguish between official and parallel market rates**
10. **Note data collection challenges** in conflict zones
