# Research Findings: UN OCHA Yemen Humanitarian Data (2010-2024)

This report summarizes the findings of a comprehensive research effort to collect economic and humanitarian data for Yemen from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the period of 2010-2026.

## 1. Data Sources

The primary data sources utilized for this research were:

*   **UN OCHA Financial Tracking Service (FTS):** The FTS provides detailed data on humanitarian funding for Yemen, including response plans, requirements, and funding levels. [1]
*   **Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX):** The HDX platform, managed by OCHA, provides access to a wide range of humanitarian datasets for Yemen, including needs assessments and response plans. [2]
*   **UN OCHA Yemen Country Office Website:** The official website for the OCHA country office in Yemen provides access to reports, publications, and other relevant documents. [3]

## 2. Key Datasets and Reports

The following key datasets and reports were identified and utilized:

*   **Yemen Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs):** Annual HRPs from 2010 to 2024 were accessed through the FTS website. These documents outline the humanitarian needs and response strategies for Yemen for each year.
*   **JIAF Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2025:** The Joint Intersectoral Analysis Framework (JIAF) for the 2025 Yemen Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan was downloaded from the HDX platform.
*   **JIAF 2.0 Technical Manual:** The technical manual for the JIAF 2.0 methodology was also downloaded from the HDX platform.

## 3. Data Extraction and Processing

Data on humanitarian funding for Yemen from 2010 to 2024 was extracted from the FTS website. The following indicators were collected for each year:

*   Total requirements
*   Funded amount
*   Unmet requirements
*   Total funding
*   Funding through the plan
*   Funding outside the plan

The extracted data was processed and converted into a structured JSON format for further analysis and use.

## 4. Data Quality and Limitations

The data collected from the FTS is considered to be of high quality and reliability. However, the following limitations should be noted:

*   The research was unable to identify any macroeconomic, trade, financial, or social data from the UN OCHA Yemen sources.
*   Data for the years 2025 and 2026 is not yet available, as the humanitarian response plans for these years have not yet been finalized.
