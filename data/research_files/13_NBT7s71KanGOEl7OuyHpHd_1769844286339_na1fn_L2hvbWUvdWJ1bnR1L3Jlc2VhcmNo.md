# ACLED Yemen Data Research Findings

## Introduction

This report summarizes the findings of a comprehensive research effort to collect economic data on Yemen from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) for the period of 2010-2026. The research was conducted as part of a larger project for the Yemen Economic Transparency Observatory (YETO).

## Research Process

The research process involved the following steps:

1.  **Initial Search:** A broad search was conducted to locate the ACLED Yemen data portal and any associated datasets.
2.  **Website Exploration:** The ACLED website, specifically the Yemen Conflict Monitor section, was thoroughly explored to identify any available economic data.
3.  **Data Download Attempts:** Attempts were made to download data from both the ACLED website and the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX). These attempts were unsuccessful due to access restrictions and empty files.
4.  **API Search:** A search for a public ACLED API was conducted, but no relevant APIs were found.
5.  **Report Review:** Reports and analysis documents on the ACLED website were reviewed to find any embedded economic data. The focus of these reports was primarily on conflict events and fatalities.

## Findings

**ACLED does not appear to be a source for the requested economic data for Yemen.** The data provided by ACLED is focused on conflict events, including fatalities, event types, actors, and locations. While this data is valuable for understanding the conflict in Yemen, it does not include the macroeconomic, trade, humanitarian, financial, or social data requested in the task description.

## Conclusion

Based on this research, it is concluded that ACLED is not a suitable source for the economic data required for the YETO platform. It is recommended to consult other sources, such as the World Bank, IMF, and UN agencies, for this type of data.
