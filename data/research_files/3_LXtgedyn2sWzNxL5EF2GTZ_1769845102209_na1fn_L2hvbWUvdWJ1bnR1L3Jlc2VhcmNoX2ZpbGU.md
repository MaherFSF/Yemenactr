## Source Category

WFP Yemen - Food security assessments, IPC data, market prices, mVAM surveys, all years 2010-2026

## Data Collection Summary

The primary sources of information were the WFP Yemen Annual Country Reports. Reports for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 were successfully downloaded and analyzed. Efforts to retrieve data for the years 2010-2021 were unsuccessful due to the unavailability of reports on the WFP website. An attempt to download food price data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) resulted in an empty CSV file.

## Data Quality and Gaps

There are significant data gaps for the years 2010-2021, as the Annual Country Reports for this period were not available on the WFP publications website. The attempt to download food price data from the HDX was unsuccessful, resulting in an empty file. The available data is primarily focused on humanitarian indicators, with limited information on macroeconomic, trade, financial, and social data.
