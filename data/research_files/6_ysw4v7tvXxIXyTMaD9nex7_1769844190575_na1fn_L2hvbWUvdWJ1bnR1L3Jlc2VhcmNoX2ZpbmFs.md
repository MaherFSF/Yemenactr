> This report summarizes the findings of a comprehensive research effort to gather economic and humanitarian data on Yemen from the UNHCR Yemen source category for the period of 2010-2026. The research focused on displacement data, refugee statistics, and other relevant humanitarian indicators.

## Research Findings

The primary source of information for this research was the UNHCR's Operational Data Portal for Yemen [1]. The portal provides a wealth of data on internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and asylum seekers in Yemen. However, the available data is concentrated in the most recent years, with limited historical data available for the 2010-2022 period. The search for macroeconomic, trade, financial, and social data from this source did not yield any specific results, as the UNHCR's focus is primarily on humanitarian metrics.

### Humanitarian Data

The most comprehensive data found relates to humanitarian indicators, particularly displacement and refugee figures. The following table summarizes the key findings:

| Indicator | Year | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| People in Need | 2023 | 21,600,000 |
| IDPs in Yemen | 2024 | 4,795,983 |
| IDP Returnees in Yemen | 2024 | 1,596,705 |
| Refugees and Asylum seekers in Yemen | 2025 | 61,240 |

Further details were extracted from the "YEMEN CCCM Cluster - 2024 Fact Sheet" [2], which provides a snapshot of the situation at the end of 2024:

| Indicator | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| People in Need | 1.8M |
| People Target | 789K |
| People Reached 2024 | 472K |
| Implementing Partners | 20 |
| Total sites in Dec | 2,284 |
| Covered Sites 2024 | 578 |
| Fund Requirement | 47.5M |
| Fund Received | 9.5M |

### Refugee and Asylum Seeker Demographics

Data on the country of origin for refugees and asylum seekers was available for January 2025 [3]:

| Country of Origin | Individuals |
| :--- | :--- |
| Somalia | 38,541 |
| Ethiopia | 16,143 |
| Syrian Arab Rep. | 2,866 |
| Iraq | 1,039 |
| Eritrea | 950 |
| Sudan | 891 |
| State of Palestine | 732 |
| Others | 78 |

## Data Quality and Limitations

The data collected is primarily focused on humanitarian indicators, with a notable lack of macroeconomic, trade, financial, and social data from the UNHCR source. The time series data is also limited, with most of the available information concentrated in the period from 2023 to 2025. While the UNHCR provides reliable and detailed data on displacement and refugees, a more comprehensive economic analysis would require consulting other sources.
