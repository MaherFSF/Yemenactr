## Data Quality Notes

The research uncovered significant data gaps, particularly for economic indicators. While health data is more readily available, it is often not disaggregated by year, making it difficult to construct time series. Much of the data is based on estimates and models due to the conflict and lack of reliable in-country data collection systems. The most comprehensive dataset was the 'All Health Indicators for Yemen' from the Humanitarian Data Exchange, but it contains a vast number of indicators, many of which are not relevant to the specific data points requested.

## Key Datasets

- Life expectancy data from WHO data portal
- Tuberculosis data from WHO data portal
- All Health Indicators for Yemen from Humanitarian Data Exchange

## Macroeconomic Data

No specific macroeconomic data such as GDP, growth rates, or inflation was found in the WHO datasets. The available data focused on health expenditures as a percentage of GDP, but without the actual GDP figures, these are of limited use.

## Trade Data

No data on trade, exports, or imports was found in the WHO datasets.

## Humanitarian Data

No specific humanitarian data on food security, displacement, or funding was found in the WHO datasets.

## Financial Data

No data on banking, currency, or inflation was found in the WHO datasets.

## Social Data

No data on labor, employment, or wages was found in the WHO datasets.

## Health Data

A large amount of health data was extracted and is available in the following files:

- `life_expectancy.json`: Contains life expectancy data for Yemen from 2000 to 2021, disaggregated by sex.
- `tuberculosis_data.json`: Contains data on tuberculosis cases in Yemen from 2000 to 2023.
- `health_data.json`: Contains a wide range of other health indicators for Yemen, however, many of these are not within the 2010-2026 timeframe or are not directly relevant to the requested economic indicators.
