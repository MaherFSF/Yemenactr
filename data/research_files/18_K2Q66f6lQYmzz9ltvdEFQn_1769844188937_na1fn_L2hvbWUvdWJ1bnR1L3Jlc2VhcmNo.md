# Yemen Customs Authority Research

## Initial Findings

The official website for the Yemen Customs Authority is https://www.yemen-customs.net/. The website contains news articles, information about customs services, and contact information. However, it does not appear to have a dedicated data portal or a section for statistical publications. The news articles provide some information about the activities of the customs authority, but do not contain the specific economic data required for this research.

I will now explore the other links from the initial search to find more direct sources of data.


## World Bank WITS Data (2010)

Source URL: https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/YEM/Year/2010/Summarytext

### Trade Data (2010)

*   **Exports (FoB):** $6,437 million
*   **Imports (CIF):** $9,255 million
*   **Trade Balance:** -$2,818 million

### Macroeconomic Data (2010)

*   **GDP (current US$):** $30,907 million
*   **GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$):** $1,040
*   **Trade balance as % of GDP:** -4.40%
*   **Trade as percentage of GDP:** 64.39%

I will now search for data for other years and other indicators.


## World Bank WITS Data (Latest)

Source URL: https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/YEM/Year/LTST/

The latest available data from the World Bank WITS is for 2019. 

### Trade Data (2019)

*   **Merchandise imports (current US$):** $4,636,000,000

I will now search for data from other sources to fill the gaps for the years between 2011 and 2018 and from 2020 to 2026.


## CEIC Data

Source URL: https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/yemen/trade-balance

CEIC provides monthly trade balance data for Yemen. The data is available up to September 2025.

### Trade Data (2025)

*   **Trade Balance (Sep 2025):** -$442.9 million
*   **Total Exports (Sep 2025):** $7.8 million
*   **Total Imports (Sep 2025):** $450.8 million

This data helps to fill in some of the more recent gaps. I will now look for more comprehensive datasets and reports that cover the entire 2010-2026 period and include the other required indicators.
