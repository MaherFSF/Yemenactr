# Bilingual UI & Internationalization Laws

## L7 — Bilingual parity

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** Every route/feature/export exists in EN and AR.

## Requirements

### UI Parity
- Arabic is **not** a translation afterthought
- Arabic is first-class RTL with proper typography
- Every English route must have Arabic equivalent
- Every feature must work in both languages

### RTL Implementation
- Use `dir="rtl"` for Arabic
- Test all layouts in RTL mode
- Charts, tables, and visualizations must render correctly RTL
- Number formatting respects locale

### Translation governance
- Use glossary for technical terms
- Maintain translation keys in code
- No hardcoded strings
- Use `react-i18next` or equivalent

### Testing checklist
For every new feature/route:
- [ ] English version works
- [ ] Arabic version works
- [ ] RTL layout is correct
- [ ] Charts render properly in RTL
- [ ] Exports work in both languages
- [ ] Navigation works in both languages
- [ ] Error messages exist in both languages

## L8 — No fake UI / no placeholders

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** No hardcoded "demo numbers" anywhere.

### If data is missing
- Show **Gap Card** UI component
- Explain what data is missing
- Link to gap ticket
- Never show `0`, `N/A`, or fake numbers

### Examples

**WRONG:**
```typescript
const gdp = data?.gdp ?? 1234567 // fake placeholder
```

**CORRECT:**
```typescript
if (!data?.gdp) {
  return <GapCard message="GDP data not yet available" ticketId="GAP-123" />
}
return <Metric value={data.gdp} />
```

## Enforcement

When building UI:
1. Test in both EN and AR
2. Test RTL rendering
3. Verify no hardcoded demo data
4. Use GapCard for missing data
5. Test exports in both languages
