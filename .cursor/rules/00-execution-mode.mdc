# Execution mode

- Work in **small PR-sized slices**. One objective per PR.
- **Do not refactor unrelated code.**
- If blocked, create a GAP ticket in `docs/GAP_TICKETS.md` and log a decision in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Only ask the operator for confirmation if an action is **irreversible** or needs **privileged secrets**.
- Every PR must include: Summary, Verification steps, Risks/Rollback.
