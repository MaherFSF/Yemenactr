# Governance & Compliance Laws

## L5 — Licensing & access compliance

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** Do **not** bypass paywalls, logins, robots, ToS.

### Implementation
- If a source needs partnership/API keys: create a gap ticket + admin outbox entry
- Mark sources with access requirements in `source_registry` table
- Track access permissions in metadata
- Never scrape restricted content
- Honor robots.txt
- Respect rate limits

## L6 — Do-no-harm, privacy, neutrality

### Privacy & safety
- **No PII** (Personally Identifiable Information)
- No operationally harmful details (e.g., location of critical infrastructure)
- No information that could enable harm

### Language neutrality
- Use neutral, objective language
- No political advocacy
- No sanction-evasion guidance
- Present data from all parties without editorial bias

### Conflict context
Yemen is in active conflict. Data platform must:
- Serve humanitarian/policy needs
- Avoid becoming tool for one party
- Maintain credibility through neutrality

## L9 — GitHub + CI are the release gate

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** No merge to `main` if CI is red.

### Enforcement
- All PRs must pass CI checks
- Required checks:
  - Lint (ESLint)
  - Typecheck (TypeScript)
  - Tests (if present)
  - Build succeeds
- Bugbot review before merge
- Release gate admin page shows status

### Breaking the rule
Only break this rule if:
1. CI infrastructure itself is broken (not the code)
2. Emergency security patch
3. Documented in commit message with explanation

In all cases, create follow-up ticket to fix properly.
