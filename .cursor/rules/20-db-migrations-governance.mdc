# DB migrations (governance-safe)

- **Additive only**: add columns/tables/indexes.
- Do not drop/rename existing columns.
- Do not overwrite historical rows.
- Defaults only if legally and logically safe; otherwise NULL + documented rationale.
- Backfills must be deterministic; if not safe, keep NULL and log the policy.
